## Description
This application uses NoSQL databases that allow you to easily store and retrieve unstructured data, which can significantly improve performance for some applications—especially those that use a lot of data.

### Case Study
The client has completed the app's front end, but they've struggled with creating an API layer on the back end because their ever-evolving ideas clash with a rigid database structure. For example, they haven't quite figured out how they'll handle comments, so trying to structure SQL tables with these unknowns is proving to be a real blocker. To get the product in front of users fast, they need to find a solution for data persistence without the constraints and rules that are inherent in SQL databases.

Even though SQL remains the most widely known and used database system, JavaScript's recent surge in popularity has led to the creation of another system: NoSQL databases, like MongoDB. MongoDB does not require the rigid structure that a SQL table does. Instead, it lets you store data in a format that works more like JSON, which allows more flexibility in app creation.

This makes MongoDB a good choice to help power the API layer of this application, because it will be able to accommodate the client's fluid ideas.

## Technologies Used

 MongoDB - a general purpose, document-based, distributed NoSQL database built for web application developers in the cloud era. It’s one of the most popular database choices for modern applications.

Mongoose - a MongoDB object-modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment, which supports both Promises and callbacks. This package is used in conjunction with MongoDB to perform CRUD operations on data.
